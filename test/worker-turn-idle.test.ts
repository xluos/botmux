/**
 * Worker side of the structured turn-idle channel.
 *
 * A `turn_idle` IPC may only settle the turn THIS worker believes is in flight:
 * accepting a stale/foreign report would mark a busy CLI idle and flush queued
 * input into it. These cases drive a real worker (fake CLI, PTY backend) through
 * the whole path — IPC → fence → idleDetector.fireIdle() → prompt_ready — and
 * pin the rejections as observable behaviour, not as source text.
 *
 * Steered (type-ahead) turns are therefore NOT a "newer turn is already
 * published" situation any more. Since #1781 a type-ahead write only holds the
 * attribution (`src/worker.ts:13817-13843`) and the held turn is promoted by the
 * running turn's own ready edge (`src/worker.ts:12804-12814`), so a report
 * frozen on the running turn is accepted inside that window — that is upstream
 * semantics (the idle edge is source-agnostic: `src/utils/idle-detector.ts:447-461`,
 * `:581-589`, `:665-691`). What stays guarded is the expensive direction: a
 * stale report is dropped once the newer turn IS active. See the last case.

  /**
   * The blocker this channel shipped with, restated for the post-#1781 worker.
   *
   * Original hazard: the turn identity was read LATER, inside the detached
   * `botmux __turn-idle-v2` child, off the worker's MUTABLE active-turn marker —
   * dsh-tui steers busy-period input, so that read could name turn B while the
   * report was about turn A. Freezing the identity inside the `agent/status`
   * callback (see the file header) is what closed it.
   *
   * What #1781 changed is WHEN a steered turn becomes the published active turn.
   * A type-ahead write no longer publishes its turn: it only holds the
   * attribution (`src/worker.ts:13817-13843`, log "Queuing type-ahead turn
   * attribution"), and the marker/capability written right after the write still
   * name the RUNNING turn (`src/worker.ts:13858-13859`). The held turn is
   * promoted by the running turn's own ready edge: `markPromptReady()` →
   * `syncQueuedTurnsFromMarkerDisk()` → `advanceQueuedTypeAheadTurn('prompt_ready')`
   * (`src/worker.ts:12804-12814`, `:4042-4058`).
   *
   * Inside that A→B window A is therefore still the worker's active turn, and
   * accepting A's frozen report is upstream semantics rather than a hole this
   * channel opened. The worker's idle edge is source-agnostic:
   * `IdleDetector.fireIdle()` → `markIdle('external')`
   * (`src/utils/idle-detector.ts:447-461`) and the OSC-7501/screen sources
   * (`:665-691`) share the single `markIdle` → `idleCallback` path (`:581-589`,
   * registered at `src/worker.ts:19560`, reaching `markPromptReady()` at
   * `:12668`/`:19678`), so any of them promotes B at that point.
   *
   * The expensive direction is what must stay pinned: once B IS the active turn,
   * a stale report still frozen on A (duplicate or delayed delivery from the
   * detached child) must be dropped before it can settle B early. That is the
   * last step below.
