# Permissions & Authorization

botmux permissions answer two questions: **who can talk to the bot** (canTalk) and **who can change session state** (canOperate — `/cd`, `/restart`, `/close`, card buttons). There are several authorization layers, from "a few named admins" to "the whole group can ask freely". This page covers all of them in one place.

## Authorization layers

| Layer | Who gets access | Scope | Quota / expiry | Operate rights | How it is written |
|-------|-----------------|-------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Admins** `allowedUsers` | Listed members | Every group and DM of this bot | Long-lived, maintained by hand | Talk **and** operate | `botmux setup`, editing `bots.json`, `/botconfig set allowedUsers` in a group |
| **Guest (per group)** `chatGrants` | Named members (people or bots) | Only the one group chosen when granting; in a topic group the grant is keyed by the `oc_` group and covers **all its topics** | **3 messages / 1 hour** by default, adjustable on approval | Talk only | `@bot /grant @someone` grant card; Dashboard member batch grant |
| **Guest (global)** `globalGrants` | Named members | Any group | Same, optional quota and expiry | Talk only | "Grant global talk" on the owner-initiated grant card |
| **Whole group open** `allowedChatGroups` | **Everyone in the group** (sender-independent; leaving the group revokes access automatically, new members take effect immediately) | One group | No quota, no expiry, until explicitly revoked | Talk only | Bare `/grant` in the group; Dashboard "authorize whole group" action |
| **On-call** | Everyone in the group | One group | **Always allowed, never quota-limited** | Talk only; new topics go straight into the bound directory, skipping repo picking | `/oncall bind <dir>`; Dashboard on-call toggle |
| **Open DMs** `p2pOpen` | Everyone inside the Lark app's availability scope | DMs only | — | Talk only | Bot config / `bots.json` |
| **Open mode** | **Anyone** | Everywhere | — | Talk and operate | The fallback state when **none** of the lists above is configured; not recommended for long-term use |

Notes:

- A bot created through normal onboarding always has its owner in `allowedUsers`, so it is a **restricted** bot by default — only listed people can use it.
- Team-trust legs (same-team peer bots / team bots / platform team members) grant talk only; see [Roles & Teams](/en/roles).
- Field-level reference: [bots.json · Permissions and authorization](/en/bots-json).

## Common operations

| What you want | How |
|---------------|-----|
| Let **the whole group** ask (no quota) | `@bot /grant` (or `/grant all`) in the group; revoke with bare `/revoke`. In a topic group it is keyed by the `oc_` group and covers all topics |
| Give **specific people** trial access for a few messages | `@bot /grant @Alice @Bob` — the bot replies with a grant card, defaulting to 3 messages / 1 hour per person |
| Set the count directly | `@bot /grant @Alice 20` — 20 messages each; the duration is still picked on the card |
| Fine-tune on the card | Duration: **1 hour / 8 hours / 1 day / 7 days / permanent**. Message quota: an integer from 1 to 1000; **leave blank for unlimited**. Whichever limit comes first ends the grant |
| Revoke someone's grant | `@bot /revoke @Alice`: removes the per-group and global guest grants; **if the person is also on the `allowedUsers` admin list, that entry is removed as well** (the reply names the affected scopes). Revoking the owner themselves, or a revoke that would leave the bot with no admin, is refused |
| Duty-group instant Q&A without repo picking | `/oncall bind ~/projects/foo` — see [On-Call Mode](/en/oncall) |
| Do it in bulk in the Dashboard | **Groups** page → the group's **Manage** modal: **member batch grant** (multi-select up to 50 members, live membership re-check before writing, optional quota and duration) and **authorize the whole group in one click** |

Only owners / admins (`allowedUsers`) can run `/grant`, `/revoke`, on-call toggles, and management commands such as `/card`, `/cot`, `/mention-mode`. Graduated guests can only talk.

## Being added to a group is not authorization

**Pulling the bot into a group does not write any allowlist entry.** When the bot receives the "added to chat" event it does not open up talk access for that group:

- On a **restricted bot** (one with an owner / allowlist — every bot created via onboarding is such a bot), a non-listed member @-mentioning the bot is **refused**, and the bot automatically sends the owner a **grant request card**. The owner approves in one click (after which the original message is replayed automatically, so the person doesn't need to resend it).
- **Only a fully unconfigured open-mode bot** can be used by anyone (operate rights included). That is a fallback state, not something "being added to a group" grants.
- "Auto-start when added to a group" (`autoStartOnGroupJoin`) is not an authorization either: it has its own gate — the group must contain at least one `allowedUsers` member before the bot auto-starts a session.

Precisely controlling who can add the bot to groups belongs to the Lark platform side (app availability scope / who can add bots); see the FAQ at the bottom.

## Block list `blockedUsers`

The block list is a **sender-dimension global deny**, maintained on the Bot config page (Dashboard **Bot Config**), with a quick "block" action available in the group-member modal as well:

- It applies to **both groups and DMs**; a blocked person is denied in on-call groups, whole-group-open groups, and team groups alike.
- The deny leg runs **before every allow leg** — on-call, whole-group open, guest grants, team trust — so there is no "works again in another group" escape.
- When a blocked person is rejected, **no grant request card** is sent to the owner (no approval-spam from someone you explicitly blocked).
- **Owners / admins cannot be blocked** — the write entry refuses it (self-lockout guard).
- The block list governs **talk access only**; the [message listener](/en/bots-json#group-message-listener) feature (rules that make a bot watch messages automatically) has its own matching configuration and is not affected by it.

## Grant request cards

On a restricted bot, when an unauthorized person explicitly @-mentions the bot in a group and the talk gate blocks them, a request card is sent to the owner by default (`autoGrantRequestCards`, on by default; can be turned off in Bot config, after which messages are blocked silently).

- On the request card the owner can **Grant talk in this group** or **Deny**, adjusting quota and duration right on the card.
- The owner-initiated `@bot /grant @someone` card additionally offers **Grant global talk** (effective in any group).
- After approval, the message that triggered the request is replayed into the session automatically; the requester doesn't need to @ again.
- Pending requests are throttled, so one person cannot spam cards.
- **A rejected DM (p2p) is silent by default**: there is no owner present in that DM, and replying with a card would go to the stranger themselves (unusable for them, and it would expose the owner), so no card is sent.
- **Forward request cards to the owner's DM** (`grantRequestToOwnerDm`, off by default): when enabled and no admin in the conversation can click the card, the card goes to the primary owner's DM instead — both when no admin is in the group (e.g. `autoInviteOwnerOnGroupAdd` is off and the owner stays out) and when a DM is rejected. The requester only gets a neutral acknowledgement that does not reveal the owner; after the owner approves or denies, the outcome is posted back to the original conversation; once the quota runs out, the next message re-applies automatically. If an admin is in the group, or the member lookup fails, the card is posted in the group as before. DM forwarding has an extra per-owner cap (20 cards per hour; failed sends do not count). Over the cap or on a send failure no card is posted (the group is already known to have no admin, so an in-group card would be one nobody can click); the next message retries. The group path lists chat members on every request (60-second cache); if the app lacks the member-read scope (`im:chat.members:read`) or the group has more than 2,000 members (no complete list), the card is posted in the group as before. Toggle it in the Dashboard (**Bot Config → Authorization & Quota**), via `bots.json`, or with `/botconfig set grantRequestToOwnerDm on`.

## Common questions

- **On-call vs bare `/grant`?** Both grant talk only, never operate. On-call is always allowed with no quota and also binds the group to a working directory (new topics skip repo picking); `/grant` only opens talk and binds no directory.
- **How do I give someone exactly 3 messages?** `@bot /grant @someone` produces the card with 3 messages / 1 hour as the defaults; pass a number after the mention or change it on the card.
- **Does every new member need owner approval?** No — whole-group open (bare `/grant`) or on-call means anyone in the group can ask immediately; per-person grants and request cards exist for when you want to keep the gate.
