# Streaming Cards

Every conversation turn produces a live-updating Lark card, your primary window for **perceiving and controlling the CLI** on your phone or in Lark.

- **Live screenshots of the terminal refreshed onto the card**: xterm renders headlessly into an image that **faithfully reproduces the CLI's TUI** (borders and colors are all there), instead of converting output to Markdown. One click to "Show / Hide output," "Export text," and "Half-page up / down."
- **Live status indicator**: the card's header color *is* the status (a Lark card template, not an emoji dot in the body) — **Starting…** (yellow) → **Working** (blue) → **Waiting for input** (green); when the quota is used up it shows **Limit reached** (red), turning to **Retryable** (green) when it can retry.
- **Operate directly from the card**: open the Web terminal, 🔑 grab an operation link, close the session, and — when the quota is retryable — "🔁 Resend last task."
- **A fresh card per turn**: the previous card freezes as an archive, keeping conversation history clear and traceable; after a session is moved to another group with [`/relay`](/en/relay), the original card also automatically freezes as an archive (buttons removed).
- **A "recoverable" card on close**: it carries a "▶️ Resume session" button to click back in anytime; **if the CLI supports native resume** (the adapter implements `buildResumeCommand` and a native session id exists), it also includes the native command (e.g. `claude --resume <id>`) for manual recovery; when unsupported, only botmux's resume button plus a short note is shown.

## The four display layers of a turn

botmux's "presence" in Lark has four independently switched layers:

| Layer | What it is | How to turn it off |
|-------|------------|--------------------|
| **Streaming status card** | The per-turn live-screenshot card (the main subject of this page) | Bot-level `disableStreamingCard`, or `/card off` for this chat |
| **Thinking bubble (CoT)** | Intermediate narration / thinking messages while the CLI works | Bot-level `cotEnabled: false`, or `/cot off` for this chat; `/cot show` reveals one round on demand |
| **✋ → ✅ reactions** | Progress reactions on **your triggering message**: ✋ when accepted, flipped to ✅ when the worker goes idle | Bot-level `silentTurnReactions: true` |
| **Proactive CLI messages** | Rich-text / image messages the agent sends via `botmux send` | No switch — sent on demand (see below) |

Reactions and streaming cards are **mutually exclusive per turn**: the ✋→✅ reactions appear only when "streaming cards are off for this chat" — with no live status window, the reaction is the only lightweight progress signal; a card-enabled chat gets no reactions.

## Card / thinking switches: bot-level vs per-chat

| Display layer | Bot-level default (Bot config / Dashboard **Bot Defaults**) | Per-chat override (in-group slash command) | Default |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| Streaming status card | `disableStreamingCard` | `/card off` / `/card on` (writes `noCardChats`); bare `/card` summons one immediately; `/card pin …` controls pinning | On |
| Thinking bubble | `cotEnabled` | `/cot off` / `/cot on` (writes `noCotChats`); `/cot show` reveals one round; bare `/cot` shows status | On |
| ✋ → ✅ reactions | `silentTurnReactions` | No per-chat command | Card-off chats get reactions automatically; `silentTurnReactions: true` silences even those |
| Card controls | `hiddenStreamingCardButtons` (choose which buttons to hide) | — | All shown |
| Card pinning | `pinStreamingCard` (default off) | `/card pin off｜on｜status` | Off |

A per-chat override wins over the bot-level default and affects only that chat.

**`/card` and `/cot` are admin-only (`allowedUsers`, canOperate)**, status subcommands included. The reason: Lark cards have no "show different views per person" capability — these switches are bot-level / chat-wide, so one change alters what **everyone in the group** sees; guests (talk access, no operate rights) get an "authorized users only" notice.

**Quiet preset** (Dashboard **Bot Defaults** page, new in this batch): one click performs a **one-time linked write** — `cotEnabled:false` + `silentTurnReactions:true` + `disableStreamingCard:true` — for groups that only want the conclusion, quietly. It is **not a persistent binding**: it simply writes those three existing switches to the values above once and shows a toast; turning the preset off later does **not** revert the three values, so re-enable each switch manually if you want it back.

## Pinning The Current Live Card

When a bot enables `pinStreamingCard`, Botmux tries to pin the **current public live-status card** to the top of the chat so the close-session and terminal entry points stay easy to reach.

- This is a **per-bot, opt-in, default-off** setting.
- Pinning is still **chat-wide** at the Feishu layer, while each active session keeps its own current/frozen streaming-card lifecycle. If the same chat has multiple active topics or multiple bots, you may therefore see multiple independently managed group-level Pin entries.
- Only the current public live-status real `streamCardId` participates.
- Repo-picker cards, private `/card` snapshots, final reply cards, CoT, closed cards, and every other interactive card stay **out of scope**.
- After the switch changes through the dashboard or `/botconfig set pinStreamingCard on/off`, Botmux immediately runs a best-effort hot reconciliation across that bot's **existing active sessions**; the configuration response itself does not wait for Feishu Pin/Unpin completion.
- `/card pin off` is the **per-chat escape hatch**: it stops Botmux from pinning streaming cards in the current chat while keeping live cards themselves enabled. `/card pin on` restores Pin for that chat, and `/card pin status` reports whether Pin is off at the bot level, opted out for this chat, or effectively on.
- Failures are **fail-open**: they never interrupt card publication, transfer, resume, close, or the configuration write. During exceptional periods you may temporarily see zero Pins or multiple Pins.
- The feature keeps no durable retry journal, and startup recovery remains deliberately narrow. On restart, Botmux lists the chat's current Pins as the single ownership authority for persisted cards: a remote Pin counts only when Feishu reports `operator_id_type: "app_id"` for the same `larkAppId`, and cleanup is further restricted to the strict intersection with the enqueue-time local candidate IDs already known to this process. An already-Pinned current card with human, other-app, mixed, or malformed provenance is left untouched and is not re-pinned. If the current card is absent, Botmux accepts a create only when the returned `data.pin` repeats both the exact message ID and same-app provenance. Botmux never broad-cleans arbitrary remote Pins, and any lookup or Pin API failure stays fail-open. Explicit bot-wide/per-chat off cleans process-owned IDs plus locally known IDs freshly proven same-app; ordinary disable, close, and transfer clean process-owned IDs only.

> **Open terminal = read-only**: the card's main "🖥️ Open Web Terminal" button is read-only viewing; for **writable** control, tap "🔑 Get operation link" — delivered **privately**: a flat group prefers an in-chat "visible-to-you" ephemeral card (so you never leave the conversation), falling back to a DM only for topic/thread or p2p chats, or when the ephemeral card fails. Management buttons like "🔄 Restart" and "apply profile" live on the **session card**, not on each turn's streaming card.

## Interrupting / correcting a running turn

To stop or correct it mid-turn, **don't wait for it to finish**: in screenshot mode the card carries a row of quick keys at the bottom — **Esc, ^C, Tab, Space, Enter, arrow keys, ⇞ Half-page up / ⇟ Half-page down**. Tapping `Esc` writes the ESC byte straight into the live terminal (exactly like pressing Esc locally); `^C` likewise. After interrupting, just add a new instruction.

> This quick-key row only appears when **output is shown (screenshot mode)** and the backend isn't `riff` — "Show output" first, then Esc is available. The default behavior is not to interrupt the current turn; new messages queue (type-ahead) and are fed in after the turn ends. To correct immediately, use Esc to break first.

## Messages the CLI proactively sends

The card body is a **live screenshot (image)** of the terminal, not text rendering. Messages the CLI proactively sends (via `botmux send`) are separate rich-text / image-and-text messages that can carry images, files, and @mentions; for fully custom display, `--card-file` / `--card-json` can send raw interactive card JSON.

> ⚠️ Raw cards allow **display-only elements + open_url buttons only**: any callback-firing control — callback buttons (with a `value`), dropdown / person selects, date-time pickers, inputs, form submits — is rejected. This prevents custom cards from forging interactive callbacks.

## Charts in messages (vega-lite)

A ` ```vega-lite ` fence in a `botmux send` body renders as a native Feishu Card 2.0 chart; other channels such as a Web view can render the same Vega-Lite directly. Supported subset:

- Inline `data.values` only, at most 500 rows, values are string / number / boolean / null.
- `mark`: `bar` (horizontal when only x is quantitative), `line`, `area`, `point`, `arc` (pie; `innerRadius > 0` for a donut). A pie takes only `theta` (value) + `color` (category); `x`/`y` are rejected and `theta` has no `title`.
- Encoding channels: `x`, `y`, `color` (series), `theta` (pie value); each channel accepts only `field`, `type`, `title`. `x`/`y` titles become axis titles and the `color` title becomes the legend title. `type: temporal` is not parsed as a date: values are shown as categories in the given order, so sort them first.
- At most 5 charts per card. The real limit is Feishu's **30KB card message request body** (including the envelope and the re-serialized `content`): once the card is assembled, charts that do not fit step down chart → 50-row data table → 10-row data table → notice only until the card fits. A single spec source is also capped at 30KB for parsing.

Safety: the host **rebuilds** the VChart spec from recognised fields and never forwards the source JSON. `data.url`, `transform`, `params`, `expr`, `signal`, `datasets`, `layer` and similar are rejected. Unsupported or over-budget charts degrade to a one-line notice plus a plain-text data table (cells never become links or mentions), `botmux send` prints the reason on stderr, and the message is still delivered.

`botmux send --dry-run` previews the rendering: it prints `{dryRun, bytes, fits, diagnostics, card}` (`bytes` is the Feishu request body size) without sending and without a session. It renders the body only (no image/file upload, mentions or footer).

## Updating a card after sending (card patch)

A successful `botmux send --card-file/--card-json` prints `{"success":true,"messageId":"om_...",...}`. `botmux card patch` updates that same card **in place** by its messageId — no new message, same chat/topic — which makes it ideal for progress cards:

```bash
# 1. Send an "in progress" card and grab its messageId from the JSON output
botmux send --card-json '{"schema":"2.0","header":{"template":"blue","title":{"tag":"plain_text","content":"Deploy progress"}},"body":{"direction":"vertical","elements":[{"tag":"markdown","content":"Progress: 0%"}]}}' --no-mention
# → {"success":true,"messageId":"om_xxx","sessionId":"..."}

# 2. Extract the messageId with jq, then patch it to 50%
MID=$(botmux send --card-file /tmp/progress.json --no-mention | jq -r .messageId)
botmux card patch --message-id "$MID" --card-json '{"schema":"2.0","header":{"template":"blue","title":{"tag":"plain_text","content":"Deploy progress"}},"body":{"direction":"vertical","elements":[{"tag":"markdown","content":"Progress: 50%"}]}}'

# 3. Patch once more when done
botmux card patch --message-id "$MID" --card-json '{"schema":"2.0","header":{"template":"green","title":{"tag":"plain_text","content":"Deploy done"}},"body":{"direction":"vertical","elements":[{"tag":"markdown","content":"✅ Shipped"}]}}'
```

- The replacement card JSON goes through the **same safety validation** as sending (display-only + open_url; callback controls are rejected).
- The `send` examples pass `--no-mention`: a progress card doesn't need to @ anyone, and explicitly opting out avoids the mention-policy gate (exit 2).
- Bot identity is resolved from the session context (same as `send`); errors such as a withdrawn message, missing permission, or a non-card target are surfaced as-is (exit 1).
- Success prints `{"success":true,"messageId":"om_xxx","sessionId":"..."}` (JSON only on stdout); usage errors exit 2.
