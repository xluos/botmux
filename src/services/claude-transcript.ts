/**
 * Stronger sibling-pane recovery anchor than the substring fingerprint
 * search. Walks every `.jsonl` in `dir` and returns the paths whose
 * trailing 1MB contains a user/queue event whose normalised text is
 * EXACTLY equal to `normalisedContent` (not a substring), respecting
 * `excludePath`, `minMtimeMs`, `minEventTimestampMs`,
 * `includeQueueOperations`, and `acceptCandidate` the same way as
 * `findJsonlContainingFingerprint`.
 *
 * Returns *all* matches in mtime-descending order — callers must
 * abstain when the result has length > 1, since multiple files containing
 * the same exact normalised content cannot be disambiguated without
 * stronger evidence (and forcing a switch would risk picking the wrong
 * pane). The caller's typical pattern is:
 *
 *   - 1 match → switch to it (legitimate post-/clear recovery)
 *   - 0 matches → no recovery this tick; wait for stronger signal
 *   - >1 match → log and abstain; surface a diagnostic to the user
 *
 * Used by the bridge fingerprint fallback's recovery path for in-pane
 * `/clear`: substring matches risk hijacking on short fingerprints (the
 * literal text "test" matches "run tests" / "test bridge"), but full
 * equality on a Lark message we just wrote is a much stronger anchor.
