/**
 * The single row-level apply for session commands.
 *
 * A session row changes only by having a command applied to it, and every
 * host applies a command the same way: the owning daemon on its in-memory row
 * (`session-store.closeSession`, the `/whiteboard` IPC route), and a host CLI
 * or the dashboard process on the durable row while no daemon holds the store
 * (`session-store.applySessionCommandUnowned` behind
 * `session-command-host.ts`). There is no second field list anywhere else.
 *
 * `applySessionRowCommand` performs no filesystem, process or network access:
 * every I/O-derived input (the close-time token snapshot) arrives on the
 * command. It runs inside the store's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` / file lock on the
 * unowned path, so anything it does is lock-hold time — keep it O(row).
 *
 * Daemon-only close options (`tokenUsage`, `parkMojoLineage`,
 * `parkLocalResidual`, `clearRiffParentTaskId`, `clearMojoCloseJournal`) are
 * typed away from hosts via {@link HostSessionCommand}: a host cannot prove a
 * remote cancel or sample a transcript it may not be able to resolve, so it
 * cannot name the actions that depend on either.
 *
 * Design: docs/design/2026-08-12-session-restage-store-first.md §1, §3 Stage 2.
