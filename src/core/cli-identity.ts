/**
 * Session credential handoff for trigger-user CLI authentication.
 *
 * The daemon knows who sent the current message; the CLI process does not. This
 * module is the channel between them: the daemon writes a small env-format file
 * per session, and a wrapper on `PATH` sources it just before exec'ing the real
 * tool.
 *
 * ## Why a file and not an environment variable
 *
 * A session is one long-lived CLI process (often a tmux pane). Its environment
 * is fixed by the kernel at spawn: the daemon cannot change it later, and a
 * child cannot rewrite its parent's. So env-injected credentials would freeze
 * whoever started the session — every later turn, by anyone, would keep running
 * as that first person.
 *
 * A file is re-read on every single CLI invocation, so the identity in force is
 * always the one the daemon wrote for the current turn. Switching people costs
 * nothing and never restarts the session (a restart would drop the CLI's whole
 * context, which in practice is unacceptable).
 *
 * ## Trust direction
 *
 * The daemon writes; the wrapper reads. The CLI process must never be able to
 * write these files — that would let an agent choose its own identity. They live
 * under the session's own data dir and are rewritten (not appended) each turn.
 *
 * ## Why `.env` and not JSON
 *
 * The wrapper is `/bin/sh` and runs on every invocation. `.` (source) is a shell
 * builtin; parsing JSON would mean spawning `jq` — measured at ~20ms extra per
 * call for zero benefit, since these files hold exactly a couple of opaque
 * values.

 *    on `PATH`, so resolving by name again would re-enter this script forever.
 *  - `BOTMUX_SESSION_ID` / `SESSION_DATA_DIR` come from the session env the
 *    worker already injects; the wrapper is identical for every session, so
 *    nothing needs rewriting when sessions come and go.
 *  - **A missing or unrecognized identity file denies the command.** The
 *    earlier version exec'd the tool anyway, on the belief that no env means
 *    "run as the bot". It does not: lark-cli then resolves the operator's
 *    on-disk login and acts as *that person* — the machine account this whole
 *    feature exists to stop. So absence is refusal, and running as the bot is
 *    something the daemon must ask for explicitly (`mode=bot`).
 *
 *    Failing this way is safe to default to: the only thing an unwritten file
 *    can mean is that the daemon has not yet decided, and borrowing a stranger's
 *    credentials while it decides is worse than not running.
 *
 *  - **The identity must belong to the turn now running.** The daemon publishes
 *    when a message is ACCEPTED; the CLI runs turns from its own queue, so
 *    while A's turn is still executing, B's message can arrive and overwrite the
 *    file — and A's remaining tool calls would then run with B's permissions.
 *    The daemon cannot close that gap alone (the worker does not wait for it),
 *    so each identity carries the turn it was published for, the worker
 *    publishes the turn it is actually executing, and a mismatch refuses.
 *
 *    The cost is real and deliberate: tool calls in the tail of A's turn fail
 *    once B has spoken. That is the trade this feature is for — a failed command
 *    is recoverable, a command that silently ran as the wrong person is not.
