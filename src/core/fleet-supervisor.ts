/**
 * Fleet supervisor — LIVE layer (owns spawn/kill/fs/timers). Replaces pm2's God
 * daemon for the multi-bot fleet. One `FleetSupervisor` process (the `__supervisor`
 * entry) spawns each bot's daemon as a `__daemon` child, monitors exits, and
 * applies the pure policy decisions (restart-with-backoff / stop / park). All
 * state goes through fleet-state-store (atomic + locked). Boot persistence stays
 * with systemd/launchd, which re-run `botmux start`.
 *
 * Safety decisions (graceful-exit, max_restarts, projection identity, idempotent
 * start, generation addressing) come from fleet-supervisor-policy — this layer
 * only does the I/O the policy tells it to.

   * ENV IS SCRUBBED HARDER THAN FOR OUR OWN MEMBERS, deliberately. A bot daemon
