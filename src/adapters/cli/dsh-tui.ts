/**
 * dsh-tui adapter — PTY-driven full-screen TUI for DeepSeek Harness.
 *
 * Unlike the headless `dsh` adapter (which spawns a JSON-RPC runner bridging
 * `dsh --profile <name>`), this adapter drives the interactive `dsh-tui` Ink TUI
 * directly through a PTY — the same interaction model as claude-code / hermes.
 *
 * The `dsh-tui` binary is a launcher that boots `dsh --profile dsh-tui`:
 *   - Positional args are the initial prompt (issue #53), but we deliberately
 *     do NOT bake the prompt into argv: the launcher treats path/URL-shaped
 *     positional args as workspace targets (DSH_TUI_WORKSPACE_TARGET), which
 *     would hijack a prompt that happens to look like a path. All prompts go
 *     through writeInput instead.
 *   - `--resume` is intercepted by the launcher (sets DSH_TUI_RESUME_SESSION
 *     from ~/.dsh-tui/resume.txt); we pass it through for session resume.
 *
 * Selection: this adapter is never chosen directly from the CLI dropdown. The
 * bot keeps cliId='dsh' + dshRuntime='tui'; the worker resolves to this
 * adapter at spawn time (see worker.ts resolveDshAdapter).
