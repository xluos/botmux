/**
 * TRAE CLI (a.k.a. traex / traecli) adapter.
 *
 * TRAE is a Codex-family CLI — it shares the same bracketed-paste input
 * protocol, `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` / `--no-alt-screen`
 * flags, `resume <uuid>` subcommand, and `›` prompt marker.
 *
 * The important difference from the upstream Codex adapter:
 *   - Data lives under ~/.trae (not ~/.codex), configurable via TRAE_HOME.
 *   - There is no global history.jsonl. Submit verification uses the threads
 *     SQLite table as the authoritative session/path index, then requires an
 *     exact role=user record in that rollout's post-submit byte delta.
 *   - Skills are installed into ~/.trae/skills.

 * TraeX active-turn busy marker. Every anchor below is extracted verbatim

 * all 9 local releases (0.201.1-alpha.5 … 0.201.2-alpha.2, both `traex` and
 * `traex-code-mode-host`):
 *
 *  - Spinner frames: the contiguous string "⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏"
 *    (braille rotation compiled into every release).
 *  - Spinner label set 1 (thinking/working rotation): "Thinking longer…",
 *    "Deep in thought…", "Almost there…", "Running command…",
 *    "Command in flight…", "Chugging along…", "Finishing up…", "Executing…",
 *    "Hang tight…", "Waiting for response…", "Any second now…",
 *    "Poking the model…", "On its way…", "Shh, it's thinking…",
 *    "Thinking…", "Reasoning through it…", "Mulling it over…",
 *    "Pondering…", "Working it out…", "Piecing it together…".
 *  - Spinner label set 2 (approval/working/queue): "Reviewing approval
 *    request", "Working…", "Working on it…", "Queued for capacity",
 *    "Queued for next turn".
 *  - Standalone queue notice: "Too many requests right now. You're in the
 *    queue."
 *
 * Older local releases had deleted Codex's "esc to interrupt" footer, but
 * TraeX 0.207.x renders it again while a turn is active. Keep it line-anchored
 * with the standalone queue states so quoted prose does not become busy proof.
 *
 * Three branches:
 *  1. Spinner-anchored labels: "<braille frame><space><label>". The frame
 *     never appears in transcript prose, so assistant output like
 *     "Working… on the fix" cannot revive a completed card. Covers the
 *     working/thinking rotation AND the spinner-prefixed queue state
 *     ("⠋ Queued for capacity" — the queue screen can render a frozen
 *     spinner frame in front of the label).
 *  2. Standalone capacity-queue strings, line-anchored
 *     (`(?:^|[\n\r])[ \t]*…`): "Queued for capacity" and the full queue
 *     notice. The queue screen can render statically (no animating spinner),
 *     so the frame anchor must not be required for it. The line anchor keeps
 *     assistant prose quoting the string mid-sentence ("…says Queued for
 *     capacity whenever…") from registering as busy.
 *  3. (staticBusyPattern below) the same queue evidence as a pre-idle latch
 *     inside IdleDetector — see TRAEX_STATIC_BUSY_PATTERN.
 *
 * Both states must be covered: the worker's busy-pattern idle probe marks
 * the prompt ready as soon as the marker leaves the viewport, so matching
 * only the queue strings would flash Idle the moment the queue resolves
 * into a real working turn.
