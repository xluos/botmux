/**

 *
 * Why this exists: several daemon/dashboard listeners (dashboard-ipc-server.ts,
 * dashboard.ts) historically did a single `server.listen(fixedPort)` with no
 * 'error' listener / no probe, so on a shared machine a second botmux instance
 * binding the same default port emitted an UNHANDLED 'error' that crashed the
 * whole process (the IPC bind even took the daemon down at startup). This
 * mirrors the already-proven probe in core/terminal-proxy.ts so those binds
 * self-heal to a free port; callers MUST advertise the returned (bound) port to
 * their consumers (the IPC port via the daemon descriptor, the dashboard port
 * via ~/.botmux/.dashboard-port) since it may differ from the requested one.
 *
 * Failure discipline: this promise MUST settle. Every wait inside it (the bind,
 * the verification, the release) is bounded; the worst case is a rejection
 * with a code the caller can log and act on, never a silent hang. The dashboard
 * starts its platform tunnel only after this resolves, so "hangs silently" here
 * reads as "machine offline" on the platform with nothing in the logs.
